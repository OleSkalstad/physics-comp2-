I was able to work on this on multiple days.
felt i knew what i was doing.
Making a sketch of what i should expect and consulting with others (mostly Anders on the physics) made it esier to know what to do and what to work on. From what i used to be, in the previus years, i have gotten better on making clear goals, which has tolerant on what i should do in due time and not stress.

the start of this project it was setting in assets that was going to be replaced. Then after that i made the assets that was going to take its place. I used blender and made the assets myself, The assets i am going to need to do the basics of the simulation is very simple and dosent take much time to make. 

after that i made the code for spawning which is a simple respawn code that i have made before.

Then came the stick that came up and down. I had sketches of how it should work. First i needed to find the the anchor point point, then find declare the tipping point. After this i can make a check if the anchor is above the tipping which is going to make the stick rotate.

The last thing is going make the other part of making it going backwards. And then we have the loop of the simulation.
